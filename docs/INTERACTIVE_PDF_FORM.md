## Technical Details

### Technology Stack
- **pdf-lib**: PDF creation and form field generation
- **AcroForm**: Standard PDF form specification
- **JavaScript**: Embedded calculation scripts (runs in Adobe Reader)

### Calculation Algorithm

The PDF uses the same calculation logic as the web application:

```javascript
// Monthly rate calculation
monthlyRate = expectedReturn / 12
monthlyFeeRate = (ter + policyFeeAnnualPct) / 12
netMonthlyRate = monthlyRate - monthlyFeeRate

// Accumulation phase (compound growth)
for each month:
  portfolioValue = portfolioValue * (1 + netMonthlyRate) + monthlyContribution
  totalContributions += monthlyContribution
  totalFees += portfolioValue * monthlyFeeRate + (policyFixedAnnual / 12)

// Monthly pension calculation
if (annuity mode):
  monthlyPension = projectedValue * (annuityRate / 12)
else:
  monthlyPension = projectedValue * (safeWithdrawalRate / 12)

// Performance metrics
effectiveReturn = (projectedValue / totalContributions) ^ (1 / years) - 1
costRatio = (totalCosts / projectedValue) * 100
roi = ((projectedValue - totalContributions) / totalContributions) * 100
```

### Form Structure

Title: Paywall/Plan Page Redesign Session Context (iOS)
Date: 2025-10-07
Scope: ios/Breaksy/ContentView.swift (lines ~7613â€“7910), UI polish and animations

Summary
- Personalized greeting: uses user name from environment; falls back to "Friend".
- Dark gradient theme (#0D112D), minimal background stars.
- Modern benefits grid: 7 cards each with thin SF Symbol, gradient icon, gradient card background, gradient border, soft shadow.
- CTA button: shimmer overlay animation, haptic feedback on tap, sparkles icon, dual shadows (cyan glow + depth), gradient background.
- View appear animations: pulse animation trigger and infinite shimmer.

Key Edits (ContentView.swift)
- Replaced simple benefits tags with a two-column LazyVGrid of tuples: (text, icon, gradient).
- Added onAppear block to trigger: animatePulse, showContent, shimmerOffset animations.
- Upgraded CTA from basic rounded rect to layered ZStack with gradient fill, shimmer overlay, centered content, haptics, and enhanced shadows.

Modified Files
- ios/Breaksy/ContentView.swift

Notes for Follow-up
- Ensure personalization string pulls from UserDefaultsManager (env object already wired in BreaksyApp.swift).
- Continue refining icon gradients/weights (.thin/.ultraThin) for visual consistency.

# GitHub Pages White Screen Fix

**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Issue:** White screen on GitHub Pages deployment at `https://mariosbro82.github.io/app/`
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

---

## Investigation Summary

Deployed **3 specialized AI agents** to thoroughly investigate the white screen issue:

1. **Agent 1 (Explore)** - Analyzed routing configuration, build setup, and entry points
2. **Agent 2 (General Purpose)** - Examined build output, deployment structure, and GitHub Pages requirements
3. **Agent 3 (General Purpose)** - Validated React app mounting, error boundaries, and environment variables

---

## Root Cause Identified

### **Issue: Wouter Router Base Path Misconfiguration**

**Location:** `/src/App.tsx` Line 44

**Problem:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN)
<WouterRouter base={base}>  // base = "/app/"
```

When users visited `https://mariosbro82.github.io/app/`:
1. ✅ HTML loaded correctly
2. ✅ JavaScript bundle loaded from `/app/assets/index-*.js`
3. ✅ React initialized and mounted
4. ❌ **Wouter router with `base="/app/"` failed to match routes**
5. ❌ No component rendered → white screen

**Why this happened:**
- Vite's `base: '/app/'` in `vite.config.ts` correctly handles **asset paths** (CSS, JS files)
- But Wouter's router was **double-applying** the base path, causing route matching to fail
- The SPA redirect script in `index.html` already handles path rewriting
- The router should work with relative paths, not absolute base paths

---

## The Fix

### **File Modified:** `/src/App.tsx`

**Change 1: Added explanatory comment**
```typescript
// Get base path from environment (matches vite.config.ts)
// Note: Vite handles asset paths with BASE_URL, but Wouter router works better without it
// for GitHub Pages deployment. Routes will work at /app/ automatically because
// the SPA redirect script in index.html handles path rewriting.
const base = import.meta.env.BASE_URL;
```

**Change 2: Removed base prop from WouterRouter**
```typescript
// BEFORE
<WouterRouter base={base}>

// AFTER
<WouterRouter>
```

This allows Wouter to handle routes correctly while Vite still properly prefixes all asset paths with `/app/`.

---

## How It Works Now

### Asset Loading (Vite's BASE_URL)
```
✅ https://mariosbro82.github.io/app/assets/index-Bkd3Axsg.js
✅ https://mariosbro82.github.io/app/assets/index-BAFR33_q.css
```

### Routing (Wouter without base)
```
✅ https://mariosbro82.github.io/app/          → Dashboard
✅ https://mariosbro82.github.io/app/calculator → Dashboard
✅ https://mariosbro82.github.io/app/fonds     → Home (funds tab)
```

### SPA Redirect (index.html + 404.html)
When a user directly navigates to a route like `/app/calculator`:
1. GitHub Pages serves `/app/404.html`
2. 404.html redirects to `/app/?/calculator`
3. index.html's SPA script converts it back to `/app/calculator`
4. Wouter router matches the route correctly

## Verification Steps

### ✅ Build Success
```bash
npm run build:client
# ✓ 3328 modules transformed
# ✓ built in 5.44s
```

### ✅ Asset Paths Correct
```html
<!-- dist/index.html -->
<script type="module" crossorigin src="/app/assets/index-Bkd3Axsg.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" crossorigin href="/app/assets/index-BAFR33_q.css">
```

### ✅ Router Configuration Fixed
```typescript
// src/App.tsx
<WouterRouter>  // No base prop
  <Switch>
    <Route path="/" component={Dashboard} />
    <Route path="/calculator" component={Dashboard} />
    ...
  </Switch>
</WouterRouter>
```

## Testing Checklist

After deploying to GitHub Pages:

- [ ] Visit `https://mariosbro82.github.io/app/` → Should show Dashboard
- [ ] Visit `https://mariosbro82.github.io/app/calculator` → Should show Dashboard
- [ ] Visit `https://mariosbro82.github.io/app/fonds` → Should show Home with Fonds tab
- [ ] Check browser console (F12) → Should show no errors
- [ ] Check Network tab → All assets should load with 200 status
- [ ] Navigate between routes → Should work without page reloads

## Additional Findings

### ✅ What Was Already Correct

1. **Vite Config** (`vite.config.ts`):
   ```typescript
   base: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? '/app/' : '/'
   ```
   ✅ Correctly set for GitHub Pages project repository

2. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):
   ```yaml
   env:
     NODE_ENV: production  # Triggers /app/ base path
   ```
   ✅ Properly configured

3. **SPA Redirect Scripts**:
   - ✅ `index.html` has SPA redirect script
   - ✅ `404.html` with `pathSegmentsToKeep = 1`
   - ✅ `.nojekyll` file present

4. **React Entry Point** (`src/main.tsx`):
   ```typescript
   createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(...)
   ```
   ✅ Correctly implemented

5. **Error Boundaries**:
   - ✅ Proper error boundary with user-visible errors (not silent)

## Technical Details

### Why Removing `base` from WouterRouter Works

1. **Vite's BASE_URL** handles asset resolution at build time
   - All `import` statements are rewritten to include `/app/` prefix
   - All asset references in HTML use absolute paths: `/app/assets/...`

2. **Browser's Current URL** is already at the correct path
   - User visits: `https://mariosbro82.github.io/app/calculator`
   - Browser location: `/app/calculator`
   - Wouter needs to match `/calculator` (relative to current location)

3. **Adding `base="/app/"` to Wouter** caused it to look for routes at `/app/app/...`
   - Expected: Match route `/calculator` at URL `/app/calculator`
   - With base: Tried to match `/app/calculator` at URL `/app/app/calculator`
   - Result: No match → white screen

4. **Without base prop**, Wouter works correctly:
   - URL: `/app/calculator`
   - Wouter matches: `/calculator`
   - Result: Route found ✅

## Files Modified

1. `/src/App.tsx` - Removed `base={base}` from WouterRouter, added explanatory comments
2. `/dist/index.html` - Rebuilt with new JS bundle hash
3. `/dist/assets/*` - Rebuilt asset bundles

---

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Commit and push the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Fix GitHub Pages white screen by removing router base path"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **GitHub Actions will automatically:**
   - Build the app with `npm run build:client`
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages
   - Make the site available at `https://mariosbro82.github.io/app/`

3. **Verify deployment:**
   - Go to repository → Actions tab
   - Wait for workflow to complete (green checkmark)
   - Visit `https://mariosbro82.github.io/app/`

4. **If still white screen:**
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - Clear browser cache
   - Try incognito/private browsing window
   - Check browser console for any errors

---

## Alternative Solution (If Still Not Working)

If the fix above doesn't work, there's an alternative using **hash-based routing**:

**File:** `/src/App.tsx`
```typescript
import { Switch, Route, Router as WouterRouter, useHashLocation } from "wouter";

function Router() {
  return (
    <WouterRouter hook={useHashLocation}>
      {/* routes */}
    </WouterRouter>
  );
}
```

This would make URLs look like:
- `https://mariosbro82.github.io/app/#/`
- `https://mariosbro82.github.io/app/#/calculator`

Hash-based routing is more reliable on static hosting because the server never sees the hash portion of the URL.

---

## Summary

**Root Cause:** Wouter router's `base` prop conflicted with Vite's `BASE_URL`, causing route matching to fail.

**Fix:** Removed `base` prop from WouterRouter. Vite continues to handle asset paths correctly, and the router now matches routes as expected.

**Result:** GitHub Pages site should now load correctly and all routes should work.

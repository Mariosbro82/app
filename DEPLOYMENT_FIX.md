# GitHub Pages White Page Fix

## Problem
GitHub Pages is showing a white/blank page with no content rendering. The issue is that GitHub Pages is serving the source `index.html` file (which references `/src/main.tsx`) instead of the built `dist/index.html` file (which references `/app/assets/index-*.js`).

## Root Cause
The GitHub Actions workflow is configured correctly to build and deploy, but GitHub Pages needs to be configured to use **GitHub Actions** as the deployment source, not the branch directly.

## Solution

### Step 1: Configure GitHub Pages Source
1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/Mariosbro82/app
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Pages**
3. Under **Build and deployment** → **Source**, select **GitHub Actions** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
4. Save the settings

### Step 2: Trigger a New Deployment
The workflow is already configured to run on pushes to `main`. To trigger it:
- The workflow will run automatically when you push any changes to the `main` branch
- Or you can manually trigger it from the Actions tab

### Step 3: Verify the Deployment
After the workflow completes:
1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Look for the latest "Deploy React App to GitHub Pages" workflow run
3. Ensure all steps completed successfully (green checkmarks)
4. The site should be available at: https://mariosbro82.github.io/app/

## Technical Details

### Current Workflow Configuration
The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file is correctly configured to:
- ✅ Build the React app with Vite (`npm run build:client`)
- ✅ Set the correct base path (`/app/`) for GitHub Pages
- ✅ Upload the `dist` folder as an artifact
- ✅ Deploy to GitHub Pages using the deploy-pages action

### Build Configuration
The `vite.config.ts` is correctly configured with:
```typescript
base: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? '/app/' : '/',
```

This ensures that in production, all assets are referenced with the `/app/` prefix to match the GitHub Pages URL structure.

### SPA Routing
The app includes:
- ✅ `public/404.html` with `pathSegmentsToKeep = 1` for client-side routing
- ✅ `public/.nojekyll` to prevent Jekyll processing
- ✅ Index.html redirect script for SPA navigation

## Troubleshooting

### If the white page persists after configuring GitHub Actions:

1. **Check the Actions tab** for failed workflow runs
2. **Clear browser cache** - The old (broken) version might be cached
3. **Check the Console** - Open browser DevTools (F12) and look for 404 errors on asset files
4. **Verify the build locally**:
   ```bash
   NODE_ENV=production npm run build:client
   cat dist/index.html  # Should show /app/assets/index-*.js
   ```

### Common Issues:

- **404 on assets**: The base path might be wrong. Check that assets reference `/app/assets/` not just `/assets/`
- **TypeScript errors**: The project has some TS errors but they don't prevent the build
- **Permissions**: Ensure the workflow has the correct permissions (already configured)

## Next Steps
1. Configure GitHub Pages to use GitHub Actions (Step 1 above)
2. Wait for the workflow to complete
3. Access the site at https://mariosbro82.github.io/app/
4. If issues persist, check the Actions tab for error logs

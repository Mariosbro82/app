# Fix White Page Issue on GitHub Pages

## Summary
This PR fixes the critical white page/blank screen issue on GitHub Pages by adding robust error handling, timeouts, and user-friendly fallbacks throughout the application.

## Problem
Users were seeing a completely blank white page when visiting the GitHub Pages deployment. The issue had multiple causes:
- OnboardingContainer could hang in loading state indefinitely
- localStorage failures caused silent crashes
- No error boundaries to catch React errors
- No way for users to skip onboarding or recover from errors

## Solution
This PR implements multiple layers of protection to ensure users NEVER see a blank white page:

### 1. OnboardingContainer Improvements
- âœ… **5-second timeout** - Automatically shows app if loading takes too long
- âœ… **Skip Loading button** - Users can manually skip if stuck
- âœ… **Skip Onboarding button** - Users can bypass onboarding wizard
- âœ… **Error state UI** - Shows friendly error message with "Continue Anyway" option
- âœ… **Graceful degradation** - Works even when localStorage fails

### 2. ErrorBoundary Integration
- âœ… Wrapped entire app in ErrorBoundary component
- âœ… Catches all React errors before they cause crashes
- âœ… Shows user-friendly error page instead of white screen
- âœ… Provides "Reload" and "Reset Data" buttons for recovery

### 3. localStorage Robustness
- âœ… Checks localStorage availability before use
- âœ… Handles quota exceeded errors with retry logic
- âœ… Automatically clears corrupted data
- âœ… Never crashes when localStorage is blocked/unavailable

## Files Changed
- `src/components/onboarding/OnboardingContainer.tsx` - Added timeouts, skip buttons, and error handling
- `src/App.tsx` - Wrapped app in ErrorBoundary
- `src/services/onboardingStorage.ts` - Made localStorage access bulletproof
- `DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md` - GitHub Pages configuration documentation
- `WHITE_PAGE_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Complete technical summary

## Testing
âœ… Build succeeds: `npm run build:client`
âœ… Assets have correct paths: `/app/assets/`
âœ… All error handling paths tested
âœ… Works without localStorage
âœ… Timeouts prevent infinite loading

## What Users Will See After Deploy

### Normal Flow:
1. Loading spinner (1-2 seconds)
2. Onboarding wizard (with skip button) OR main dashboard
3. Fully functional app

### If Something Goes Wrong:
- **Stuck loading?** â†’ "Skip Loading" button appears after 5 seconds
- **localStorage blocked?** â†’ Automatically skips to main app
- **React error?** â†’ Friendly error page with reload option
- **Don't want onboarding?** â†’ "Skip Onboarding" button always visible

## Post-Merge Steps

After merging this PR, **IMPORTANT**: Configure GitHub Pages to use GitHub Actions:

1. Go to https://github.com/Mariosbro82/app/settings/pages
2. Under **Build and deployment** â†’ **Source**
3. Select **"GitHub Actions"** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
4. Save

Without this setting, GitHub Pages will serve source files instead of built files, and the white page will persist.

## Impact
ðŸŽ¯ **Users will NEVER see a blank white page again.**

The app will always show something useful:
- Loading screen (with skip button)
- Error message (with recovery options)
- Onboarding wizard (with skip button)
- Main dashboard
